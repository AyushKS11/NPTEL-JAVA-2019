Week 2 :


Q1 Complete the code segment to call the method  print() in class Student following the concept of inner class.
 // This is the outer class named School
class School { 
    // This is the inner class named Student
    class Student { 
		// This is a method in inner class Student
        public void print() { 
			System.out.println("Hi! I am inner class STUDENT of outer class SCHOOL."); 


System.out.println("NPTEL");
        } 
    } 
} 
public class Question211{ 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
// Create an object of inner class Student

// Access the 'print()' method of the inner class Student using the inner class object

A1 School ob = new School();
   School.Student ob1=ob.new Student();
  ob1.print();



Q2 Complete the code segment to call the method  print() of class Student first and then call print() method of class School.
    // This is the class named School
class School { 
    // This is a method in class School
    public void print() { 
		System.out.println("Hi! I class SCHOOL."); 
    } 
} 
// This is the class named Student
class Student { 
	// This is a method in class Student
    public void print() { 
		System.out.println("Hi! I am class STUDENT"); 
    } 
}

public class Question212{ 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
  
A2  Student s1 = new Student(); 
    School s2 = new School();
    s1.print();
    s2.print();
         } 
    }


Q3 Complete the code segment to call print() method of class Question by creating a method named ‘studentMethod()’.

      // This is the main class Question
        public class Question213{ 
        public static void main(String[] args) { 
        // Object of the main class is created
        Question213 q = new Question213();
        // Print method on object of Question class is called
        q.studentMethod();
        }

      // 'print()' method is defined in class Question
      void print(Question213 object){
        System.out.print("Well Done!");
      }

    // Define a method named 'studentMethod()' in class Question

    // Call the method named 'print()' in class Question

A3  public void studentMethod()
  {
    Question213 ob=new Question213();
    print(ob);
  }
  }



Q4 Complete the code segment to call default constructor first and then any other constructor in the class Answer.
   // This is the main class Question
public class Question214{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Answer a = new Answer(10,"MCQ");
	}
} 

A4 // This is the class Answer
    class Answer{
      // This is the default constructor of the class Answer
      Answer(){
        System.out.println("You got nothing.");
      }
      // This is a parameterized constructor of the class Answer
      Answer(int marks, String type){
        //The 'this()' referene variable is able to call the default constructor of the class.
        this();		
        //Print marks and type of the question
        System.out.println("You got "+marks+" for an "+ type);
        }
      } 



Q5 Complete the code segment to debug the program which is intended to print 'NPTEL JAVA'.
     public class Question215{ 
      public static void main(String[] args) { 

  //Declare variable with name 'nptel', 'space' and 'java' and proper datatype.

  //Initialize the variables with proper input

A5 String nptel,space,java;
    nptel="NPTEL";
    space=" ";
    java="JAVA";


         System.out.print(nptel+space+java);
       }
    }
